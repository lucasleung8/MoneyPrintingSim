# MoneyPrintingSim
Money Printing Sim is a small scale incremental game written in p5js similar to Cookie Clicker, but printing money instead of cookies. This was originally coded in a Python version of p5js on Replit, that our teacher provided for the class. Having finished early, I am now porting it to real p5js (this repo) as a personal project.
Your goal is to make as much money as possible; along the way you will collect upgrades, earn achievements and more.


Idea
--------
While being inspired to create an incremental/idle game, I decided to use similar concepts found in other popular games such as Cookie Clicker, Clicker Heroes, AdVenture Capitalist, Tap Titans, etc., to create "Money Printing Sim".
