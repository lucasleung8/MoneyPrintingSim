<p align="center">
Money Printing Sim is a small scale incremental game written in p5.js. This was originally coded in a Python version of p5.js on Replit, that our teacher provided for the class. Having finished early, I am now porting it to real p5.js (this repo) as a personal project.

Idea
--------
While being inspired to create an incremental/idle game, I decided to use similar concepts found in other popular titles such as Cookie Clicker, Clicker Heroes, AdVenture Capitalist, Tap Titans, etc.

How to Play
-----
Go to the GitHub pages link listed in the repo description (https://mrworldwide1.github.io/MoneyPrintingSim/), your progress autosaves every 10s to the browser's localstorage
