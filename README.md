<h1 align="center">Money Printing Sim</h1>

<p align="center">
Money Printing Sim is a work-in-progress incremental game written in p5.js. This was originally coded in a Python version of p5.js that our teacher provided for the Grade 11 Computer Science class. Having finished early, I am now porting it to real p5.js here as a personal project.

Idea
--------
While being inspired to create an incremental/idle game, I decided to use similar concepts found in other popular titles such as Cookie Clicker, Clicker Heroes, AdVenture Capitalist, Tap Titans, etc.
